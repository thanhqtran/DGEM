% the sensitivity of generalized eigenvalues.

    Code and description taken from Lemonnier and Van Dooren, Balancing
    regular matrix pencils, SIAM J. Matrix Anal. Appl., Vol. 28, 2006, pp. 253-263, p. 662.

    The diagonal matrices Dl and Dr are constrained to powers of 2 and are computed iteratively
    until the number of iterations max_iter is met or until the norms are
    between 1/2 and 2. Convergence is often reached after 2 or 3 steps.
    The diagonals of the scaling matrices are returned in Dl and Dr
    and so is iter, the number of iterations steps used by the method.
