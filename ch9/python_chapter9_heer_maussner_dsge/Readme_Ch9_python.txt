readme_ch9_python.txt: this file

RCh91v.py:	main program file, equivalent to the GAUSS program 'RCh91v.g', as described in Chapter 9.1.2


Instructions:
=============

In order to run the Python programs, you simply need to store the file in a directory and run it.

In line 23, you can specify if you want to use 'linear interpolation' or 'cubic spline interpolation. By default, we
apply cubic spline interpolation.

The program is described in much more detail in our tutorial:

In order to run the program, you should have installed Python and access to the library numpy.

A good introduction into Python and a description of the installation of Python can be found on
the website of Thomas Sargent and John Starchuski
